In this project, we will teach you making a car turning flasher circuit. This is a very simple and useful electronics project circuit.
To make this circuit, we are using LED (5mm), Transistor (BD-139), Resistors, Capacitors and only DC-12v power supply circuit. We don’t use any power switch/ signal switch.
To make a perfect car turning flasher circuit, we might need to use two-way switching system.


Component List – 

For making this useful project circuit, we might need some simple electronics component. You also can order assembled PCBs form JLCPCB.
JLCPCB have its parts library. To check JLCPCB parts library, click here - https://jlcpcb.com/parts

All Component list have to been given below – 

1.	Transistor – BD 139
	
2.		Capacitor – 47µf / 25v

3.	Resistors – 10 KΩ

4.	LED – 5mm
	
5.	Power Source – DC 12v

6.	PCBs (made by JLCPCB)


Transistor Pin Out -

The BD-139 is an NPN complementary low voltage NPN transistor in 3 pin SOT-32 package. 
Products are pre-selected in DC current gain. Collector to emitter voltage (Vce) is 80v and collector current  (IC) is 15A.
We know the transistor have 3 legs. 

If we count its leg from left side then 1st leg Emitter, 2nd leg Collector and 3rd leg Base.
